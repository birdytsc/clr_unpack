# clr_unpack

A Tool to unpack the .RBM CAFF files from the game Conker Live and Reloaded.

can be compiled for both the Retail and Demo versions of the game check common.h and comment out the #define RETAIL line to compile for the demo version.

The compression algorithm is just ripped from the games binary as x86 assembly you can check it out in the caff.cpp file.

I have no idea what algorithm it is however.
